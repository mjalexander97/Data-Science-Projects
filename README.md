# Data-Science-Projects
Code and reports from projects that I have worked on as an undergraduate at UCSB or in my personal time. Explanations of each project and the skills used can be found below: 

## Anime Recommendation Project (Python, Data Cleaning, Machine Learning)

  A program that recommends anime based on cosine similarity of ratings from thousands of users. 

## Taylor Swift Lyrics Analysis (Python, Data Cleaning, Text Processing/NLP) 

  An analysis of Taylor Swift lyrics to try to see how her songwriting and song themes have evolved over the course of her career. 
  
## Visualization of Volunteer Hours by Location and Demographics of Volunteers, Partners in Education (Tableau, Microsoft Excel)  
  
   As an intern at Partners in Education, I was assigned to work on a project that would help our Executive Director gain a better understanding of the impact our organization was having at each of our site locations. Being an organization that strived to expand the knowledge and opportunities of students in Santa Barbara county, it was extremely important for the company to know which of our school locations were receiving enough volunteer support and to identify those that required additional assistance. 

Using the organization's own volunteer data base, I created a custom dataset of specifically chosen attributes to help me investigate where most of our volunteer support was being sent. After creating this data set, I then used Microsoft Excel to clean and prepare the information for analysis. During the information gathering period, I also considered it would be interesting to see the demographics of our volunteer pool as well. By the end of the project, I had created visualizations that observed volunteer hours by location via scatterplot and Tableau mapping software, and a chart that summarized the demographic composition of our volunteers. 

Due to my work on this project, I helped begin outreach to lesser served schools, and sparked a conversation about ways to equalize the demographic composition of the volunteer pool.


## PSTAT 126: Regression Analysis (RStudio)
  
   The purpose of this project was to answer the following question: can happiness be predicted based on an individual's gender, number of hours worked per week, and the satisfaction of one's relationship on a scale of 1 - 10. 
   This project involved  creating, assessing, and interpreting various regression models, as well as discusing the results. The data set was provided  by a professor.  


## PSTAT 131: Data Mining/Statistical Machine Learning (Rstudio)

   The final project for this class was to use a comprehensive data set of the 2016 election that contained polling results from all counties and states to gain insight into the election result. To accomplish this, the following data mining techniques were used:     
      
  - Cleaning and manipulating the data set to include the most important variables.  
  - Creating and interpreting visualizations using ggplot.   
  - Dimensionality reduction of the data using Principal Component Analysis.  
  - Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.    
      
   The data set was provided by a professor. 
    
      
## PSTAT 135: Big Data Analytics (PySpark)

   Over the course of a quarter, I worked with two other classmates to investigate whether the category of a Jeopardy question could be predicted based on the content of the question. The following programming skills were used:  
   
   - Data cleansing and preparation of the questions for analysis (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, etc).     
   - Creating Bisecting K-Means, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classification models to answer our research question. This involved creating a pipeline that used Hashing TF, IDF, and Indexing algorithms before running our three models.  
       
   Our project was presented to the class during the final week of the quarter, along with a submission of a report with detailed explanations of our procedure and findings. The data set was found via Kaggle.
