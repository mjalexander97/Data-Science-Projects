Code and reports from projects that I have worked on as an undergraduate at UCSB: 

PSTAT 126 Regression Analysis (RStudio)
  
  The purpose of this project was to answer the following question: can happiness be predicted based on an individual's gender , number of hours worked per week, and the satisfaction of one's relationship on a scale of 1 - 10. This project involved  creating, assessing, and interpreting various regression models, as well as discusing the results. The data set was provided  by a professor.
