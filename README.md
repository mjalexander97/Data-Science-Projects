# Data-Science-Projects
Code and reports from projects that I have worked on as an undergraduate at UCSB. Explanations of each project and the skills used can be found below: 

* PSTAT 126: Regression Analysis (RStudio)
  
    The purpose of this project was to answer the following question: can happiness be predicted based on an individual's gender , number of hours worked per week, and the satisfaction of one's relationship on a scale of 1 - 10. This project involved  creating, assessing, and interpreting various regression models, as well as discusing the results. The data set was provided  by a professor.  


* PSTAT 131: Data Mining/Statistical Machine Learning (Rstudio)

    The final project for this class was to use a comprehensive data set of the 2016 election that contained polling results from all counties and states to gain insight into the election result. To accomplish this, the following data mining techniques were used: 
      * Cleaning and manipulating the data set to include the most important variables  
      * Creating and interpreting visualizations using ggplot   
      * Dimensionality reduction of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
      * Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression    
      
    The data set was provided by a professor. 
    
      
* PSTAT 135: Big Data Analytics (PySpark)

    Over the course of a quarter, I worked with two other classmates to investigate whether the category of a Jeopardy question could be predicted based on the content of the question. The following programming skills were used:   
       * Data cleansing and preparation of the questions for analysis (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, etc)   
       * Creating Bisecting K-Means, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes classification models to answer our research question. This involved creating a pipeline that used Hashing TF, IDF, and Indexing algorithms before running our three models.  
       
    Our project was presented to the class during the final week of the quarter, along with a submission of a report with detailed explanations of our procedure and findings. The data set was found on Reddit. 
      
  
* Visualization of Volunteer Hours by Location and Demographics of Volunteers, Partners in Education (Tableau, Microsoft Excel)  
  
  
    I created a representation of Partnersâ€™ volunteer hours by school locations to better understand the impact Partners in Education has in Santa Barbara and Santa Maria county, as well as observe the demographics of the volunteer pool. I Used Microsoft Excel in conjunction with company database to gather and scrub the relevant data for analysis. During this project, I learned how to import datasets into Tableau and various methods of data visualization using the software in a short period of time. The final product was presented by the Executive Director to the company Board of Directors at a later meeting.
